## 3️⃣ What is GitLab?

### Definition

**GitLab is a complete DevOps platform built around Git.**

It not only stores code, but also:

* Builds the code
* Tests the code
* Deploys the application

### Why Companies Prefer GitLab

* Built-in CI/CD (no extra tools required)
* Strong access control and security
* Can be installed **inside company data centers**

### Indian IT Company Scenario 🇮🇳

In companies like:

* TCS
* Infosys
* Wipro
* Accenture

Security rule:

* ❌ Code cannot be public
* ✅ Must stay within company network

👉 **Self-hosted GitLab** is used
