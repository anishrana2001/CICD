## 1️⃣ Why Do We Need Git? (The Problem Statement)

### Real-life Indian Scenario 🇮🇳

Imagine a **college group project** with 4–5 students.

* Everyone edits the same files
* File names become:

  * `final.doc`
  * `final_final.doc`
  * `final_final_v3_really_final.doc`

👉 Confusion, overwriting, and blame games.

### Core Questions

* Who changed the file?
* What exactly was changed?
* Can we go back to yesterday’s version?

## 👉 **Solution: Git**

## What is Git?

### Definition

**Git is a distributed version control system.**

It tracks changes in files, maintains history, and allows multiple people to work together safely.

### What Git Does

* Saves versions (like checkpoints in a game 🎮)
* Tracks:

  * Who made the change
  * What was changed
  * When it was changed
* Works **offline** on your local system

### What Git is NOT

* ❌ Not a website
* ❌ Not GitHub or GitLab
* ❌ Not cloud-based by default

### Simple Example

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial version of project"
```

### 👉 Git now remembers this state permanently.
